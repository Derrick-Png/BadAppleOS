# Overview
- Writing Kernel

From my interpretation of the meaning of the kernel, I see that it is just executing compiled C code. So, to ensure this works, I would make the OS flood the screen with As!

Before that, I have restructured the code, so it looks like this
```
src/   
    boot/
        boot.asm
        gdt.asm
        ...
    legacy/
        print.asm
    BadApple.mp4
    boot.bin
```

Alright on to coding,

the formula that we would use to calculate the address we are at is 
```
0xb8000 + 2 * (row * 80 + col)
```
where there are 80 rows and 24 columns.

```
void main() {
    // Prints white
    char* video_memory = (char *) 0xb8000;
    int maxrows = 80;
    int maxcols = 25;
    int row = 0;
    int col = 0;
    while(row < maxrows)
    {
        *(video_memory + 2 * (row * 80 + col)) =  'A';
        col++;
        if(col == maxcols)
        {
            col = 0;
            row++;
        }
    }
}
```
This is the code for printing As, the "kernel". After puting the boot.bin and the binary format of the printa.c together, I found one huge problem. My boot loader is 
- Not loading any Disk
- disk_load not created

Sooo, I have to jump back to previous chapters...
