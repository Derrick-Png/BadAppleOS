# RickRollOS
 An operating system that boots up to play a single video **on loop**

This is a solo project, I would not be accepting pull requests (if there are any) as it is as part of a learning process for me : ) 

This is project is still in progress

# Introduction
This project's main objective is to boot up an OS, load and play a single video in loop.

This idea was solely inspired by the upward trend of people playing Bad Apple on everything, so I am giving it a try. Learning while trolling at the same time.

3 Main things that I am creating from scratch (Not final):
1) OS (10% of project)
2) Media Player? (90% of project)
    - Color
    - "Graphics" Library
3) Audio Library?



# Prerequisites for building
1) NASM (For Compiling ASM)
2) Qemu (For emulating VM)
